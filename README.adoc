Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web, native, and desktop (via electron). It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

== Trying it Out

The documentation for this version is in the http://book.fulcrologic.com/[Developer's Guide]. If you're using
Fulcro 2, you can still read the http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro2[prior version of the guide].

There is also a https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[template project] which you can use as a starting point.

Finally, there is a plenty of great resources collected at the https://fulcro-community.github.io/[Fulcro Community] site.

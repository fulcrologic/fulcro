Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web, native, and desktop (via electron). It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.
3.0:: This version. Rewrote the internals to simplify a lot of things, make others
more extensible, all while preserving the shape of the API. It is not 100% API compatible with prior versions, and uses
new namespaces.  In particular, in the course of fixing some long-standing issues, subtle semantic differences were desirable/unavoidable in the
transaction processing system. Most of the surface level differences are simply in the naming of things.

== Trying it Out

The documentation for this version is in the http://book.fulcrologic.com/[Developer's Guide]. If you're using
Fulcro 2, you can still read the http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro2[prior version of the guide].

There is also a https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[template project] which you can use as a starting point.

Finally, there is a plenty of great resources collected at the https://fulcro-community.github.io/[Fulcro Community] site.

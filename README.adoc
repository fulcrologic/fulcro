Fulcro 2.0 is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React, is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript (so it has first-class functional abilities with immutable data) which leads to a very clean
synchronous story for the UI. The result is a library that dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate and incidental complexity
in your software.

Fulcro 1.0 is still supported but is only getting bug fix releases at this point. Version 1.0 was an
add-on library for Om Next. Fulcro 2.0 no longer has a dependency on Om Next, though the surface API
is still very similar (though in different namespaces). See link:/README-fulcro-2.0.adoc[README-fulcro-2.0.adoc] for
porting instructions and the reasoning behind the change.

*NOTE*: If you are using Java 9, you may need to include "--add-modules java.xml.bind" to your JVM.

== Writing Applications with Fulcro

The https://fulcrologic.github.io/fulcro[website] is a great place to read about
Fulcro. It has pages describing things in more general terms, and has links
to various resources like videos and evaluation guides.

If you want to jump and code, read on!

=== Getting Started

New users are encouraged to do one or both of the following:

. Follow along with the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_Rwb8LUwW4AdjAu-39PHgEE[YouTube] video series.
. Follow along with the _Getting Started_ chapter of the http://book.fulcrologic.com/#_getting_started[Developer's Guide].
. Do the Fulcro Tutorial. See below.

Experienced users that want to dive right in can use the `lein` template,
which emits a bare-bones full-stack app with dev, testing, uberjar, i18n, and devcards support:

```
lein new fulcro my-project
```

If you don't know Clojure, you should at least get comfortable with the basics.
I recommend: http://www.braveclojure.com/[Clojure for the Brave and True], and doing at least the
basic online exercises at http://www.4clojure.com/[4Clojure]. You should also have
a passing familiarity with Facebook's React, though if you understand that we're
using it to get "fast UI updates", that is sufficient to start.

=== The Fulcro Tutorial

The tutorial is an interactive coding tutorial using Devcards. To do it:

. Clone the main https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro[Fulcro repository].
. Run the tutorial and follow the instructions.

There is a shell script in the top-level directory that will start the tutorial:

```
./run-tutorial.sh
```

just follow the instructions it emits.

== Fulcro Developers Guide

Yes! There is a book on Fulcro that covers all of the features in detail! You can read it at
http://book.fulcrologic.com[].

== Contributors

Fulcro is maintained by Fulcrologic, LLC. The primary architect and maintainer is Tony Kay.

Fulcro expands on the work of David Nolen's Om Next, and that code represents about 30% of 2.0's code base.
Much of the core API is similar, but this
library is intended to be an easier-to-use alternative that follows the original simplicity of design while eliminating
some experimental features of that library, and rounding out the story with a complete concrete implementation
that is easy to use.

Many people have contributed to this library. Much of the original internal work was part of Om Next and
as written by David Nolen. Some of the contributions of Antonio Monteiro have also been incorporated.

Fulcro itself originated as an effort of Navis in Bend, Oregon. Tony Kay was the primary architect, and numerous people
contributed in that original project (known as Untangled).

Fulcro can therefore be considered a fork of Untangled and Om Next.

See the github statistics for information on all contributors.

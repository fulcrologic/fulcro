Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web, native, and desktop (via electron). It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

== Fulcro 3.8 Important Notice

Fulcro 3.8+ use a new version of Fulcro Inspect, and it requires you change how you build the development version of your app. Old versions of Fulcro Inspect Electron and Chrome will not work with Fulcro 3.8+.

The rewrite of Fulcro Inspect is available via the releases page of https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect/releases[Fulcro Inspect]. And there are https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect[preliminary instructions] for using it with the latest Fulcro.

The alpha versions of Fulcro 3.8 are alpha purely because of this development-time change and its potential issues, and are otherwise production ready.

== Trying it Out

The documentation for this version is in the http://book.fulcrologic.com/[Developer's Guide]. If you're using
Fulcro 2, you can still read the http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro2[prior version of the guide].

There is also a https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[template project] which you can use as a starting point.

Finally, there is a plenty of great resources collected at the https://fulcro-community.github.io/[Fulcro Community] site.

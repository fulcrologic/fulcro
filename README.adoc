Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

Fulcro 3 is currently in Beta (August 2019).

Official release candidates of version 3 will begin as soon as beta releases have been tested against enough code to give
us high confidence that the library is usable in production. We hope to have an official release of 3.0 by the
end of summer 2019, including updated documentation, videos, and sample application(s).

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.
3.0:: This version. A nearly complete rewrite of the internals.  Simplifies a lot of things, makes others
more extensible, and preserves the shape of the API; however, it is not 100% API compatible with prior versions.  In
particular in the course of fixing some long-standing issues subtle semantic differences were desirable/unavoidable in the
transaction processing system.

== Trying it Out

The documentation is being update in the http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro3[*new* revision of the Developer's Guide]. The
docstrings in the namespaces have mostly been updated as well.

There is a https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[template project] in progress which you can use as a starting point.

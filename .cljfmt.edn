{;; Formatting options matching IntelliJ/Cursive settings
 
 ;; Always use 2 spaces for indentation (equivalent to "Default to Only Indent")
 ;; This applies [:inner 0] to all forms, giving consistent 2-space indentation
 :indents ^:replace {#".*" [[:inner 0]]}
 
 ;; Align map keys and values in columns (experimental feature)
 ;; Example: {:key-one   value-1
 ;;           :key-two   value-2}
 :align-map-columns? true
 
 ;; Standard formatting options
 :indentation?                    true
 :remove-surrounding-whitespace?  true
 :remove-trailing-whitespace?     true
 :insert-missing-whitespace?      true
 :remove-consecutive-blank-lines? false
 
 ;; Note: For binding alignment in let/binding forms, there is an :align-associative?
 ;; option, but it uses an older fork of cljfmt and has known bugs. If you need this
 ;; feature, you can add:
 ;; :align-associative? true
 ;; However, this may cause issues with some forms and lacks recent cljfmt updates.
 
 ;; Reader conditionals (#?) are formatted automatically by cljfmt

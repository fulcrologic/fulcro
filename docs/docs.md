# Getting Started

Fulcro has a number of resources that can get you going.

## Developer's Guide

The [Developer's Guide](http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro3) covers the entire
library, and also has a Getting Started chapter that is great for beginners.

## API Documentation

Browse the [API Documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/com.fulcrologic/fulcro) in order to learn which functions are available.

Most functions have good doc strings that explain the purpose of the function. Use your IDE's help to see these documentation elements.

            <p>
                Fulcro picks up where Om Next left off, and provides a completed story for writing data-driven
                web applications.

            <h2 class="blue">Cohesive Architecture</h2>
            <p>
            Fulcro's architecture spans the entire stack. You can still use any technologies you wish (SQL, Datomic,
            GraphQL, and even REST if you want), but the architecture provides APIs and structure that help you 
            interface consistently across your enterprise.

            <h2 class="blue">Solve problems</h2>
            <p>Concentrate on solving your real application problems. Fulcro defines a small set of primitives, a
            normalized client-side graph data model, and a clear interface between that model and external
            data souces. Your application is all about the data model, and providing the architecture for
            managing that model across the entire stack reduces the number of things you have to cope with 
            when solving your real problems.

        Evaluating tools for web development can be a monumental task. Fulcro is a
        full-stack, batteries-included library that is aimed at making data-driven
        applications for the web. Some of the core goals are to preserve local reasoning, 
        ease production support, and maintain rapid development. Of course, it is hard to make such a
        big decision on a simple list of "features", nor should you!
        </p>
        <p>
        Each set of tools have particular strengths that may or may not be a good fit.
        To help you evaluate it, you might want to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Do your homework and read the <a href="http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro3">Fulcro Developer's Guide</a></li>
            <li>Clone and edit the <a href="https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template">Fulcro template</a></li>
            <li>Use the <a href="evaluation.html">Fulcro Evaluation Spreadsheet</a></li>

        <p class="p1">
          We're using Fulcro at figshare for some internal projects, and we're actually impressed with how Fulcro, by
          offering a complete story, just removes most of the accidental complexity from our code. Fulcro really
          challenges your assumptions regarding front-end complexity and just how much of it is inherent and incidental.
        </p>
        <p class="green">Adi Enasoaie - figshare CTO</p>
        <p class="p1">
            We started our product with re-frame, but as it grew the ease of re-frame turned
            into complexity in our application, resulting in lot's of bugs and inefficiencies.
            When we ported to Fulcro many of our bugs and inefficiencies were completely solved by
            the solid data model and full-stack integration.
        </p>
        <p class="green">Mitchel Kuijpers</p>
        <p class="p1">Fulcro is the best web framework for using Lisp in 2016. It's for building robust applications and
            solving difficult problems, not building a mediocre blog in a weekend. At AdStage it was
            our first full stack Clojure project and it took 3 developers 4 months to deliver the
            smoothest launch in our company's history. </p>
        <p class="green">Karan Toor</p>
        <p class="p1">With Fulcro all the plumbing is built-in, and I'm impressed on how
            often my assumptions match with their implementation. Because of this I can focus on the specifics of the
            application.

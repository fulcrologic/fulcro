# Editing the Website

These instructions assume a UNIX-like (OSX in particular) OS.

The website uses [the merlot template](https://github.com/pages-themes/merlot).

You should be able to get a local rendering system going to preview your
edits by following these instructions:

1. Make sure you have xcode installed with command line tools `xcodeselect --install`.
2. Use homebrew to install Ruby and gem support `brew install ruby`
3. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Then you should be able to:

```bash
$ cd docs
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

and then use the URL it gives you. It will recompile on save, but you have
to reload the browser page to see changes.

## Layout

The file `_layout/default.html` defines the layout wrapper. This is where the
top links and logo are hard-coded.

## Publishing

Do edits on the `develop` branch unless it is some kind of hot fix (in
which case you should use git flow hotfix).

The live website is auto-generated from the current `master`. So, merging
and pushing to master will update the website.

Remember to update the devguide javascript!

```bash
$ lein do clean, cljsbuild once devguide-live
```

should regenerate `docs/js/guide.js`. You should test that new version
by looking at the Queries and Bootstrap pages locally before a commit:

```
$ cd docs
$ open guide.html
```

You will need to commit that for the devguide to update on the website.

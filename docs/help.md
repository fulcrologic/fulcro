# Getting Help

If you're just getting started, please be sure you've at least watched a few of the
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_Rwb8LUwW4AdjAu-39PHgEE) and tried
the [documentation](docs.html).

If you're still scratching your head and need someone to talk to, the best place to go
is Slack. You can get a free invite via [https://clojurians.herokuapp.com/](https://clojurians.herokuapp.com/).
Once you're in the [Clojurians Slack Channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/), look for us in the
#fulcro channel.

It is possible that someone has already asked your question, so it can be useful to search the 
[Clojurians Slack Archive](https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/).
I'd recommend using the following Google Search to find past converations:

```
site:https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/fulcro WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW
```

which will target your results just to our channel.

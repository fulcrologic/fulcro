#?(:cljs

     "# Autocomplete

     A fairly common desire in user interfaces is to try to help the user complete an input by querying the server
     or possible completions. Like many of the demos, the UI for this example is intentionally very bare-bones
     so that we can primarily concentrate on the data-flow that you'll want to use to achieve the effect.

     Typically you will want to trigger autocomplete on a time interval (e.g. using `goog.functions/debounce`)
     or after some number of characters have been entered into the field. We're going to implement it in the
     following way:

     - The autocomplete query will trigger when the input has at least 2 characters of input.
     - The server will be asked for 10 suggestions, and will update on a debounced interval.
     - The autocomplete suggestion list will clear if length goes below 2
     - The user must use the mouse to select the desired completion (we're not handling kb events)

     ## Basic Operation

     The basic idea is as follows:

     - Make a component that has isolated state, so you can have more than one
     - Decide when to trigger the server query
     - Use load, but target it for a place that is not on the UI
        - Allows the UI to continue displaying old list while new load is in progress
        - Use a post-mutation to move the finished load into place

     ## The Server Query

     For our server we have a simple list of all of the airports in the world that have 3-letter codes. Our
     sever just grabs 10 that match your search string:

     ```
     (defn airport-search [^String s]
       (->> airports-txt
         (filter (fn [i] (str/includes? (str/lower-case i) (str/lower-case s))))
         (take 10)
         vec))

     (defquery-root :autocomplete/airports
       (value [env {:keys [search]}]
         (airport-search search)))
     ```

     ## The UI and Post Mutation

     We create a helper function so we don't have to manually generate the ident for autocomplete wherever we need it:
     "
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source autocomplete-ident)
     "
     We use Closure's debounce to generate a function that will not bash the server too hard. Load's will run at most
     once every 500ms. Notice that the server query itself is for airport suggestions, and we use the `:target` option
     to place the results in our autocomplete's field:
     "
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source get-suggestions)
     "
     Notice also that when we trigger the load it goes into the auto-complete widget's `:autocomplete/loaded-suggestions` field.
     The UI renders the `:autocomplete/suggestions`. We do this so there is no flicker on the UI while loading, but
     at the end of the load we need to update the suggestions. We do this by running this post mutation:

     ```
     (defmutation populate-loaded-suggestions
       \"Fulcro mutation: Autocomplete suggestions are loaded in a non-visible property to prevent flicker.
         This copies it over to the visible area\"
       [{:keys [id]}]
       (action [{:keys [state]}]
         (let [autocomplete-path (autocomplete-ident id)
               source-path       (conj autocomplete-path :autocomplete/loaded-suggestions)
               target-path       (conj autocomplete-path :autocomplete/suggestions)]
           (swap! state assoc-in target-path (get-in @state source-path)))))
     ```

     ### The List of Matches

     The list is a React component, but only for organization. It is not a stateful component at all and receives all
     data from the parent:
     "
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source CompletionList)
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ui-completion-list)
     "### The Autocomplete Control

     This is where most of the magic happens. Read the comments within the source for details:
     "
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Autocomplete)
     (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ui-autocomplete)
     "### An Example

     The following is a root component, and then a devcard that demos the live result. This is a full-stack example
     so make sure you're running the demo server (see the Introduction page of the demos).

  # App database exercises

  There are TODO placholders in the \"tables\" in this file. Replace the TODO with code

  When you have completed the task described by an exercise, the tests
  for those exercises will turn green.")

  "In this exercise, you'll verify that you understand
  the database format.

  Create a table named `:cars/by-id` with the following items:

  ```
  { :id 1 :make \"Nissan\" :model \"Leaf\" }
  { :id 2 :make \"Dodge\" :model \"Dart\" }
  { :id 3 :make \"Ford\" :model \"Mustang\" }
  ```

  These tests shown below will pass when the table is
  correctly formatted. Remember that we need to `get-in` the database
  to retrieve in ident's value. Think get in \"table\" at \"id\" or \"index\"
  to retrieve the required data. So make sure your database is responsive to this
  lookup pattern.
  "

  (is (= "Dodge" (-> cars-table (get-in [:cars/by-id 2]) :make)))
  (is (= "Ford" (-> cars-table (get-in [:cars/by-id 3]) :make))))

(dc/deftest exercise-2
  "In this exercise, you'll use Idents to link together data
  in an app database.

  Merge the cars table into provided favorites database, then
  add a `:favorite-car` key that uses an ident to reference
  the Nissan Leaf. Remember that `:favorite-car` should be
  point to a single instance.

(dc/deftest exercise-3
  "This exercise has you build up more of a UI, but all as normalized
  components.

  Say you want to have the following UI data:

  ```
  { :main-panel { :toolbar { :tools [ {:id 1 :label \"Cut\"} {:id 2 :label \"Copy\"} ]}
                  :canvas  { :data [ {:id 5 :x 1 :y 3} ]}}}
  ```

  but you want to normalize tool instances using :tools/by-id, data via :data/by-id.
  Also, you need to normalize the toolbar and the canvas data into their own tables respectively,
  and look them up with [:toolbar :main] and [:canvas :main]. Remember that `[:main-panel :toolbar]`
  and `[:main-panel :canvas]` refer to single instances like `:favorite-car`. While this pattern
  seems contrived in this example, you will find it provides flexibility in your UI.

  Build the normalized database in `ex3-uidb`.

  The following tests will pass when you get the format correct.

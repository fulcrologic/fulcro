  "## Overall goal

  In the following exercises we'll build a UI using `defsc`.
  Once the UI is built, we'll add in a little component local state and callback handling.

  The UI will show a list of people and their partners.

  The overall UI should look as shown below (which is build with plain React dom elements
  and function composition):

  NOTE: We name our component factories with a `ui-` prefix. This makes it much easier for the reader to
  visually distinguish our components from regular functions, and also prevents accidental name clases with
  data. For example, you might have `:person/address` that turns into a local data item called `address`. If your
  React renderer for that was also called `address` you'd have a problem.

  "## Exercise 1 - A UI component

  Create an Fulcro Person UI component. No need to add a query yet. The main
  task is to make sure you understand how to get the properties via
  `prim/props`.

  The template is in this tutorial file just above this card.

  You've got it right when the following card renders a person and their mate:

  "## Exercise 2 - A UI tree

  Continue and build out two more components as seen in the source just above this card.

  NOTE: If you look in the
  data below, you'll see our desired UI tree in data form. Use `props` to pull out the
  correct pieces at each level of the rendered UI. When you do this correctly, the
  card should render properly. Be careful around the `:widget` nesting.

  ## Exercise 3 - Component local state

  Components can store local information without using the global app state managed by Fulcro. It is initialized with
  this method in the options section of your `defsc`:

  ```
  (defsc Component [this props]
   {:initLocalState (fn [] { map-of-data-to-store })}
   ...
  ```

  Then use `prim/get-state`, `prim/update-state!`, and `prim/set-state!` to work with the state.

  Add component local state to your Person class, and update the UI so that when
  the person is checked their name becomes bold.

  The proper attributes for the checkbox input are `:checked` and `:onClick`.

  To ensure you got the initial state right make it the default that a person is checked.

  (fn [state-atom _]
    (ui-person @state-atom))
  {:db/id 1 :person/name "Joe"}
  {:inspect-data true})

(defcard exercise-4
  "
  ## Exercise 4 - Computed properties

  In Fulcro, you should not try to pass callbacks directly through props, but should *attach* them instead
  using `prim/computed`.

  ```
  (ui-component-factory (prim/computed props { :computed-thing 4 }))
  ```

  They may be retrieved from the 3rd argument to `defsc` (or by using `prim/get-computed` on either the `props` or `this`)

  In Fulcro you should manage the modification of lists from the owner
  of the list (because the list is, after all, rendered by that component); however, in our UI the delete button for
  a person is *rendered* in the Person component. Declare a placeholder function in PeopleWidget called `deletePerson`
  that just logs a message to the javascript console (e.g. `(js/console.log \"delete\" p)`,
  where p is the argument passed to the function).

  Pass that function through to each person as `onDelete`, and hook it up to the `X` button.

  Verify it works by checking the console for the messages.

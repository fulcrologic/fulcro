(defn load
  "Load data from the server.

  This function triggers a server interaction and normalizes the server response into your app state database. During
  operation it also adds (by default) fetch markers into the app state so you can show busy indicators on the UI
  components that are waiting for data. The `:target` parameter can be used to place the data somewhere besides app
  state root (which is the default).

  The server will receive a query of the form: [({server-property (prim/get-query SubqueryClass)} params)], which
  a Fulcro parser will correctly parse as a join on server-property with the given subquery and params. See the AST and
  instructions on parsing queries in the developer's guide.

  Parameters:
  - `app-or-comp-or-reconciler` : A component instance, Fulcro application, or reconciler
  - `server-property-or-ident` : A keyword or ident that represents the root of the query to send to the server. If this is an ident
  you are loading a specific entity from the database into a local app db table. A custom target will be ignored.
  - `SubqueryClass` : A component that implements IQuery. This will be combined with `server-property` into a join for the server query. Needed to normalize results.
    SubqueryClass can be nil, in which case the resulting server query will not be a join.
  - `config` : A map of load configuration parameters.

  Config (all optional):
  - `target` - An assoc-in path at which to put the result of the Subquery. If supplied, the data AND load marker will appear
    at this path. If not supplied the data and marker will appear at `server-property` in the top-level of the client app state
    database. Ignored if you're loading via ident (the ident is your target).
  - `remote` - Optional. Keyword name of the remote that this load should come from.
  - `params` - Optional parameters to add to the generated query
  - `marker` - Boolean to determine if you want a fetch-state marker in your app state. Defaults to true. Add `:ui/fetch-state` to the
  target component in order to see this data in your component.
  - `refresh` - A vector of keywords that will cause component re-renders after the final load/mutations. Same as follow-on
  reads in normal `transact!`
  - `parallel` - If true, indicates that this load does not have to go through the sequential network queue. Defaults to false.
  - `post-mutation` - A mutation (symbol) to run after the data is merged. Note, if target is supplied be sure your post mutation
  should expect the data at the targeted location. The `env` of that mutation will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.
  - `post-mutation-params` - An optional map  that will be passed to the post-mutation when it is called. May only contain raw data, not code!
  - `fallback` - A mutation (symbol) to run if there is a server/network error. The `env` of the fallback will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.
  - `without` - An optional set of keywords that should (recursively) be removed from the query.

  Notes on UI Refresh:
  The refresh list will automatically include what you load (as a non-duplicate):
  - When target is set and has 2+ elements: refresh will include an ident of the first two elements
     - e.g. `:target [:a 1 :thing]` -> `:refresh [[:a 1]]`
  - When target has a single element, refresh will include that element as a keyword
     - e.g. `:target [:thing]` -> `:refresh [:thing]`
  - When there is no target:
     - If prop-or-ident is a kw -> `:refresh [kw]`
     - If prop-or-ident is an ident -> `:refresh [ident]`
  In all cases, any explicit refresh things you include will not be dropped. The computed refresh list
  is essentially a `(-> original-refresh-list set add-computed-bits vec)`.

     Queue up a remote load from within an already-running mutation. Similar to `load`, but usable from

     well as including a `remote-load` for that remote.

     Note the `:refresh` parameter is supported, and defaults to empty. If you want anything to refresh other than
     the targeted component you will want to include the :refresh parameter.

     To use this function make sure your mutation specifies a return value with a remote. The remote
     should use the helper function `remote-load` as it's value:

(defn load-field
  "Load a field of the current component. Runs `prim/transact!`.

  Parameters
  - `component`: The component (**instance**, not class). This component MUST have an Ident.
  - `field`: A field on the component's query that you wish to load.

  Named Parameters:
  - `without`: See `load`
  - `params`: See `load`
  - `post-mutation`: See `load`
  - `post-mutation-params`: See `load`
  - `parallel`: See `load`
  - `fallback`: See `load`
  - `marker`: See `load`
  - `remote`: See `load`
  - `refresh`: See `load`

  NOTE: The :ui/loading-data attribute is always included in refresh. This means you probably don't want to
  query for that attribute near the root of your UI. Instead, create some leaf component with an ident that queries for :ui/loading-data
  using a link  query (e.g. `[:ui/loading-data '_]`). The presence of the ident on components will enable query optimization, which can
  improve your frame rate because we will not have to run a full root query.

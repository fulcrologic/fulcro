(defn load
  "Load data from the server.

  This function triggers a server interaction and normalizes the server response into your app state database. During
  operation it also adds (by default) fetch markers into the app state so you can show busy indicators on the UI
  components that are waiting for data. The `:target` parameter can be used to place the data somewhere besides app
  state root (which is the default).

  The server will receive a query of the form: [({server-property (prim/get-query class-or-factory)} params)], which
  a Fulcro parser will correctly parse as a join on server-property with the given subquery and params. See the AST and
  instructions on parsing queries in the developer's guide.

  Parameters:
  - `app-or-comp-or-reconciler` : A component instance, Fulcro application, or reconciler
  - `server-property-or-ident` : A keyword or ident that represents the root of the query to send to the server. If this is an ident
  you are loading a specific entity from the database into a local app db table. A custom target will be ignored.
  - `class-or-factory` : A component that implements IQuery, or a factory for it (if using dynamic queries). This will be combined with `server-property` into a join for the server query. Needed to normalize results.
    class-or-factory can be nil, in which case the resulting server query will not be a join.
  - `config` : A map of load configuration parameters.

  Config (all optional):
  - `target` - An assoc-in path at which to put the result of the Subquery (as an edge (normalized) or value (not normalized)).
    Can also be special targets (multiple-targets, append-to,
    prepend-to, or replace-at). If you are loading by keyword (into root), then this relocates the result (ident or value) after load.
    When loading an entity (by ident), then this option will place additional idents at the target path(s) that point to that entity.
  - `initialize` - Optional. If `true`, uses `get-initial-state` on class-or-factory to  get a basis for merge of the result. This allows you
    to use initial state to pre-populate loads with things like UI concerns. If `:initialize` is passed a map, then it uses that as
    the base target merge value for class-or-factory instead.
  - `remote` - Optional. Keyword name of the remote that this load should come from.
  - `params` - Optional parameters to add to the generated query
  - `marker` - Boolean to determine if you want a fetch-state marker in your app state. Defaults to true. Add `:ui/fetch-state` to the
  target component in order to see this data in your component.
  - `refresh` - A vector of keywords that will cause component re-renders after the final load/mutations. Same as follow-on
  reads in normal `transact!`
  - `parallel` - If true, indicates that this load does not have to go through the sequential network queue. Defaults to false.
  - `post-mutation` - A mutation (symbol) to run after the data is merged. Note, if target is supplied be sure your post mutation
  should expect the data at the targeted location. The `env` of that mutation will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.
  - `post-mutation-params` - An optional map  that will be passed to the post-mutation when it is called. May only contain raw data, not code!
  - `fallback` - A mutation (symbol) to run if there is a server/network error. The `env` of the fallback will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.
  - `update-query` - A optional function that can transform the component query before sending to remote.
      For example, to focus a subquery using update-query:
          {:update-query #(prim/focus-subquery % [:my {:sub [:query]}])}

      Removing properties (like previous :without option):
          {:update-query #(df/elide-query-nodes % #{:my :elisions})}
  - `focus` - An optional subquery to focus on some parts of the original query.
  - `without` - An optional set of keywords that should (recursively) be removed from the query.
  - `abort-id` - An ID (typically a keyword) that you can use to cancel the load via `fulcro.client/abort`.

  Notes on UI Refresh:
  The refresh list will automatically include what you load (as a non-duplicate):
  - When target is set and has 2+ elements: refresh will include an ident of the first two elements
     - e.g. `:target [:a 1 :thing]` -> `:refresh [[:a 1]]`
  - When target has a single element, refresh will include that element as a keyword
     - e.g. `:target [:thing]` -> `:refresh [:thing]`
  - When there is no target:
     - If prop-or-ident is a kw -> `:refresh [kw]`
     - If prop-or-ident is an ident -> `:refresh [ident]`
  In all cases, any explicit refresh things you include will not be dropped. The computed refresh list
  is essentially a `(-> original-refresh-list set add-computed-bits vec)`.

(defn load-field
  "Load a field of the current component. Runs `prim/transact!`.

  Parameters
  - `component`: The component (**instance**, not class). This component MUST have an Ident.
  - `field`: A field on the component's query that you wish to load.
  - `parameters` : A map of: (will also accept as named parameters)

    - `without`: See `load`

    - `remote`: See `load`
    - `refresh`: See `load`
    - `abort-id`: See `load`

  NOTE: The :ui/loading-data attribute is always included in refresh. This means you probably don't want to
  query for that attribute near the root of your UI. Instead, create some leaf component with an ident that queries for :ui/loading-data
  using a link  query (e.g. `[:ui/loading-data '_]`). The presence of the ident on components will enable query optimization, which can
  improve your frame rate because we will not have to run a full root query.

  WARNING: If you're using dynamic queries, you won't really know what factory your parent is using,
  nor can you pass it as a parameter to this function. Therefore, it is not recommended to use load-field from within
  a component that has a dynamic query unless you can base it on the original static query (which
  is what this function will use).

(defn lazily-loaded
  "Custom rendering for use while data is being lazily loaded using the data fetch methods
  load-collection and load-field.

  `data-render` : the render method to call once the data has been successfully loaded from
  the server. Can be a factory method or a React rendering function.

  `props` : the React properties for the element to be loaded.

  Optional:

  `ready-render` : the render method to call when the desired data has been marked as ready
  to load, but the server request has not yet been sent.

  `loading-render` : render method once the server request has been sent, and UI is waiting
  on the response

  `failed-render` : render method when the server returns a failure state for the requested data

  `not-present-render` : called when props is nil (helpful for differentiating between a nil and
  empty response from the server).

  Example Usage:

  ```
  (defui Thing
    static prim/IQuery
    (query [this] [{:thing2 (prim/get-query Thing2)}])
    Object
    (componentDidMount [this]
       (load-field this :thing2))

    (render [this]
      (let [thing2 (:thing2 (prim/props this))]

  (defui Thing2

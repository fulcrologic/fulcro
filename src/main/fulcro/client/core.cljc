(defn new-fulcro-client
  "Entrypoint for creating a new fulcro client. Instantiates an Application with default values, unless
  overridden by the parameters. If you do not supply a networking object, one will be provided that connects to the
  same server the application was served from, at `/api`.

  If you supply a `:request-transform` it must be a function:

  ```
 (fn [{:keys [body headers]}] {:body body' :headers headers'})
  ```

  it can replace the outgoing EDN of body or headers (returning both as a vector). NOTE: Both of these are clojurescript types.
  The edn will be encoded with transit, and the headers will be converted to a js map. IMPORTANT: Only supported
  when using the default built-in single-remote networking.

  `:initial-state` is your applications initial state. If it is an atom, it *must* be normalized. Fulcro databases
  always have normalization turned on (for server data merging). If it is not an atom, it will be auto-normalized.

  `:started-callback` is an optional function that will receive the intiailized fulcro application after it is
  mounted in the DOM, and is useful for triggering initial loads, routing mutations, etc. The reconciler is available
  under the `:reconciler` key (and you can access the app state, root node, etc from there.)

  `:network-error-callback` is a function of two arguments, the app state atom and the error, which will be invoked for
  every network error (status code >= 400, or no network found), should you choose to use the default built-in
  networking.

  `:migrate` is optional. It is a (fn [state tid->rid] ... state') that should return a new state where all tempids
  (the keys of `tid->rid`) are rewritten to real ids (the values of tid->rid). This defaults to a full recursive
  algorithm against all data in the app-state, which is correct but possibly slow).  Note that tempids will have an tempid data type.
  See reconciler documentation for further information.

  `:transit-handlers` (optional). A map with keys for `:read` and `:write`, which contain maps to be used for the read
  and write side of transit to extend the supported data types. See `make-fulcro-network` in network.cljs. Only used
  when you default to the built-in networking.

  `:shared` (optional). A map of arbitrary values to be shared across all components, accessible to them via (prim/shared this)

  `:read-local` (optional). An read function for the Parser. (fn [env k params] ...). If supplied,
  it will be called once for each root-level query key. If it returns `nil` or `false` for that key then the built-in Fulcro read will handle that
  branch of the root query. If it returns a map with the shape `{:value ...}`, then that will be used for the response. This is *not*
  recursive. If you begin handling a *branch* (e.g. a join), you must finish doing so (though if using recursion, you can technically handle just
  the properties that need your custom handling). At any time you can use `prim/db->tree` to get raw graph data from the database for a branch.
  NOTE: *it will be allowed* to trigger remote reads. This is not recommended, as you will probably have to augment the networking layer to
  get it to do what you mean. Use `load` instead. You have been warned. Triggering remote reads is allowed, but discouraged and unsupported.

  `:networking` (optional). An instance of FulcroNetwork that will act as the default remote (named :remote). If
  you want to support multiple remotes, then this should be a map whose keys are the keyword names of the remotes
  and whose values are FulcroNetwork instances.

  `:mutation-merge (optional). A function `(fn [state mutation-symbol return-value])` that receives the app state as a
  map (NOT an atom) and should return the new state as a map. This function is run when network results are being merged,
  and is called once for each mutation that had a return value on the server. Returning nil from this function is safe, and will be ignored
  with a console message for debugging. If you need information about the original mutation arguments then you must reflect
  them back from the server in your return value. By default such values are discarded.
  
  `:reconciler-options (optional). A map that will be merged into the reconciler options. Currently it's mostly
  useful to override things like :root-render and :root-unmount for React Native Apps.`

  There is currently no way to circumvent the encoding of the body into transit. If you want to talk to other endpoints
  via alternate protocols you must currently implement that outside of the framework (e.g. global functions/state).

(defn merge-state!
  "Normalize and merge a (sub)tree of application state into the application using a known UI component's query and ident.

  This utility function obtains the ident of the incoming object-data using the UI component's ident function. Once obtained,
  it uses the component's query and ident to normalize the data and place the resulting objects in the correct tables.
  It is also quite common to want those new objects to be linked into lists in other spot in app state, so this function
  supports optional named parameters for doing this. These named parameters can be repeated as many times as you like in order
  to place the ident of the new object into other data structures of app state.

  This function honors the data merge story for Fulcro: attributes that are queried for but do not appear in the
  data will be removed from the application. This function also uses the initial state for the component as a base
  for merge if there was no state for the object already in the database.

  This function will also trigger re-renders of components that directly render object merged, as well as any components
  into which you integrate that data via the named-parameters.

  This function is primarily meant to be used from things like server push and setTimeout/setInterval, where you're outside
  of the normal mutation story. Do not use this function within abstract mutations.

  - app-or-reconciler: The Fulcro application or reconciler
  - component: The class of the component that corresponsds to the data. Must have an ident.
  - object-data: A map (tree) of data to merge. Will be normalized for you.
  - named-parameter: Post-processing ident integration steps. see integrate-ident!

  Any keywords that appear in ident integration steps will be added to the re-render queue.

  See also `fulcro.client.primitives/merge!`.

   (defmacro ^{:doc      "Define a stateful component. This macro emits a React UI component with a query,
   optional ident (if :ident is specified in options), optional initial state, optional css,
   optional forms, and a render method. It can also emit additional protocols  that you specify.

   The argument list can include destructuring to pull items from props or computed. `children` will be a
   sequence (possibly nil) of child react components that were passed to the component's factory.

   Following the argument list is an options map:

   ```
   (defsc Component [this props computed children]
      { :query [:db/id :component/x {:component/child (prim/get-query Child)} {:component/other (prim/get-query Other)}]
        :form-fields [(f/id-field :db/id) ...] ; See IForm in forms for description of form fields
        :css [] ; fulcro-css local-rules
        :css-include [] ; fulcro-css include-children
        :ident [:COMPONENT/by-id :db/id]
        :protocols [Object
                    (shouldComponentUpdate [this] true)]
        ; Use :param/x to indicate a value that should come from the caller of get-initial-state on this component
        :initial-state {:db/id 4 :component/Child {} :component/other [{}]} }
      body)
   ```

   The options map supplies the necessary information to build the component's ident, query, initial state,
   render method, form support, component-local CSS rules, and any additional arbitrary protocols.
   It is also used to error check your code. For example, you may destructure props:

   ```
   (defsc Component [this {:keys [db/id component/x] :as props} computed children]
      { :query [:db/id :component/x]
      ...)
   ```

   If the destructuring of props tries to pull data that the options map does not have in `:query`, then an error will
   result at compile time, alerting you to your error. Many other things are also checked (that you query for the ID
   field, that initial state only initializes things you query, etc.). This can prevent a lot of common errors when
   building your UI.

   ## Initial State

   IMPORTANT: Initial state using the template (a map) treats the top-level map as the actual data. Anything
   nested in this map as keys *that match a join in the query* are automatically transformed into calls
   to `(fc/get-initial-state)`. This is so that error-checking can be performed. Any parameters you expect to
   receive in your initial state will be mapped via keywords in the `params` namespace:

   ```
   (defsc Component [this {:keys [db/id component/x] :as props} computed children]
      { :initial-state {:db/id 2 :component/x {:db/id :params/child-id}}
       :query [:db/id {:component/x (get-query X)}]
      ...)
   ```

   means:

   ```
   static fc/InitialAppState
   (initial-state [t {:keys [child-id]}] {:db/id 2 (fc/get-initial-state X {:db/id child-id})})
   ```

   If the initial state includes keys that do not appear in your query, then it will issue an error. You may
   avoid this by writing it as a method instead.

   ## Error Checking

   The above for uses templates to succinctly express the methods. When you use the template style you're more
   restricted in what you can do, but it is also less error prone because the defsc macro can check your component
   for many errors (such as a typo in desctructuring).

   You may write methods instead of data templates, which loosens the checking (depending on what you still leave
   as a template). For example, if you make `:ident` a method, the macro is still able to verify destructuring against
   `:query`.

   ## Using Methods Instead

   You may instead use methods on
   `:query`, `ident`, `initial-state`. Using the method forms turns off much of the error checking.

   ```
   (defsc Component [this props computed children]
     {:query (fn [this] [:x])
      :initial-state (fn [t p] {:x 1})
      :ident (fn [this props] [:table (:db/id props)])
      ...}
     (dom/div ...))
   ```

   See section M05-More-Concise-UI of the Developer's Guide for more details.

   NOTE: `defsc` automatically declares your component with `:once` metadata for correct operation with hot code reload.

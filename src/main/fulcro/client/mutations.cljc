                       The given symbol will be prefixed with the namespace of the current namespace, as if
                       it were def'd into the namespace.

                       The arglist should be the *parameter* arglist of the mutation, NOT the complete argument list
                       for the equivalent defmethod. For example:

                          (defmutation boo [{:keys [id]} ...) => (defmethod m/mutate *ns*/boo [{:keys [state ref]} _ {:keys [id]}] ...)

                       The mutation may include any combination of action and any number of remotes (by the remote name).

                       If `action` is supplied, it must be first.

                       (defmutation boo \"docstring\" [params-map]
                         (action [env] ...)
                         (my-remote [env] ...)
                         (other-remote [env] ...)
                         (remote [env] ...))

                       There is special support for placing the action as a var in the namespace. This support
                       only work when using a plain symbol. Simple add `:intern` metadata to the symbol. If
                       the metadata is true, it will intern the symbol as-is. It it is a string, it will suffix
                       the symbol with that string. If it is a symbol, it will use that symbol. The interned
                       symbol will act like the action side of the mutation, and has the signature:
                       `(fn [env params])`. This is also useful in devcards for using mkdn-pprint-source on mutations,
                       and should give you docstring and navigation support from nREPL.

  Allowed customization props (through computed):

  :accept - The MIME types (comma-separated string) allowed.

  :multiple? - If the upload should let the user select multiple files.

  :renderFile - A custom `(fn [upload-id file-props] DOM)` to render the files that selected for upload.
  `upload-id` is the ID of the file upload control that owns the file.
   See fulcro.ui.file-upload/File's query for details of available file-props. Can invoke
   the `cancel-file-upload` mutation to cancel an upload (which is why you need the upload-id).

  :renderControl - A custom `(fn [onChange accept multiple?] DOM)` that will render the DOM for the control that appears to allow
  users to add files. Must output at least an `input` of type `file` with onChange set to the function it
  receives. If set, `accept` is the acceptable MIME types, and `multiple?` is if the control should allow more
  than one file to be selected. The upload input UI component will hide the control if it is not multiple and

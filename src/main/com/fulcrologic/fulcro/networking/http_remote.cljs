(defn fulcro-http-remote
  "Create a remote that (by default) communicates with the given url (which defaults to `/api`).

  The options map can contain:

  * `:url` - The URL to contact
  * `:request-middleware` - See below
  * `:response-middleware` - See below
  * `:make-xhrio` - A constructor function to build a goog.net.XhrIo object, initialized however you see fit.
  * `:preprocess-error` - A `(fn [xhrio-result] fulcro-result)`. Defaults to #(merge % {:status-code 500}).

  The request middleware is a `(fn [request] modified-request)`. The `request` will have `:url`, `:body`, `:method`, and `:headers`. The
  request middleware defaults to `wrap-fulcro-request` (which encodes the request in transit+json). The result of this
  middleware chain on the outgoing request becomes the real outgoing request. It is allowed to modify the `url`.
  If the the request middleware returns a corrupt request or throws an exception then the remote code
  will immediately abort the request. The return value of the middleware will be used to generate a request to `:url`,
  with `:method` (e.g. :post), and the given headers. The body will be sent as-is without further translation.

  `response-middleware` is a function that returns a function `(fn [response] mod-response)` and
  defaults to `wrap-fulcro-response` which decodes the raw response and transforms it back to a response that Fulcro can merge.

  The response will be a map containing the `:outgoing-request` which is the exact request sent on the network; `:body`, which
  is the raw data of the response. Additionally, there will be one or more of the following to indicate low-level
  details of the result: `:status-code`, `:status-text`, `:error-code` (one of :none, :exception, :http-error, :abort, or :timeout),
  and `:error-text`.  Middleware is allowed to morph any of this to suit its needs.

  DEPRECATED: If the response middleware includes a `:transaction` key in the response with EQL, then that EQL will be
  used in the resulting Fulcro merge steps. This can seriously screw up built-in behaviors. You are much better off ensuring
  that your query matches the shape of the desired response in most cases.

  The definition of `remote-error?` in the application will deterimine if happy-path or error handling will
  be applied to the response.  The default setting in Fulcro will cause
  a result with a 200 status code to cause whatever happy-path logic is configured for that specific
  response's processing.
  For example, see `m/default-result-action!` for mutations, and `df/internal-load` for loads. The `:body` key
  will be considered the response to use, and the optional `:transaction` key an override to the EQL query used
  for any merges.

  See the top-level application configuration and Developer's Guide for more details."

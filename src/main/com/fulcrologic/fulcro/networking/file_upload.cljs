  "Attach js Blob or ArrayBuffer objects to the `params`. This requires that you use `http-remote` and that you
   also install `wrap-file-upload` middleware. If you use js/File objects then the filenames of those objects
   will be available to the mutations on the server.

   Example usage:

   ```
   (let [uploads [(file-upload/new-upload \"test\" some-js-file)
                  (file-upload/new-upload \"other\" other-js-file)]]
     (comp/transact! this [(some-mutation (attach-uploads {} uploads))]))

   If you are using a browser file input, you can use `evt->uploads`:

   ```
   (dom/input {:type \"file\"
               :multiple true
               :onChange (fn [evt]

   `transit-options` - A map of options to be included when converting the mutation and params for transmission. See
                       `transit/transit-clj->str`. Use this to extend the transit support. This is necessary because
                       the regular request middleware will not be used to send transactions that include file uploads,
                       so any extensions to transit must be done in both places.

   NOTE: This middleware acts as the end of the chain when it detects the need for a file upload, and rewrites the body,
   method, and clears any content-type header. As such, it should be used in the middleware so that it will be executed
   first:

   ```

     (->

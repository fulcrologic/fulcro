(ns com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations
  "Mutations are the central mechanism of getting things done in Fulcro. The term mutation refers to two things:

  * The literal data that stands for the operation. These are lists with a single symbol and a map of parameters. In
  earlier version, you had to quote them: `'[(f {:x 1})]`, but Fulcro 3 includes a way to declare them so that they
  auto-quote themselves for convenience. This can be confusing to new users. Remember that a mutation call is nothing
  more than a *submission* of this data via `comp/transact!` (i.e. call `f` with the parameter `{:x 1}`).
  * One or more definitions of what to do when the mutation is requested.

  The former are submitted with `transact!` and can be written like so:

  ```
  ;; The unquote on the parameters is typically needed because you'll use surrounding binding values in them.
  (let [x 3
        some-local-value 42]
    (comp/transact! this `[(f ~{:x x}) (g ~{:y some-local-value})]))
  ;; or, if pre-declared and required:
  (let [x 3
        some-local-value 42]
    (comp/transact! this [(f {:x x}) (g {:y some-local-value})]))
  ```

  This works because a mutation *definition* actually builds a record that response to function calls. This means

  ```
  (defn func [x] (inc x))
  (defmutation f [params] ...)

  ;; A regular function runs when called...
  (func 3)
  ;; => 4

  ;; A mutation simply returns its expression when called:
  (f {:x 1})
  ;; => (f {:x 1})
  ```

  This allows you to embed a mutation expression without quoting in your calls to transact (if desired) or with
  quoting if you have something like a circular reference problem.

  See the Developer's Guide for more information.

       "Define a Fulcro mutation.

     The given symbol will be prefixed with the namespace of the current namespace, and if you use a simple symbol it
     will also be def'd into a name that when used as a function will simply resolve to that function call as data:

     ```
     (defmutation f [p]
       ...)

     (f {:x 1}) => `(f {:x 1})
     ```

     This allows mutations to behave as data in transactions without needing quoting.

     Mutations can have any number of handlers. By convention things that contain logic use names that end
     in `action`.  The remote behavior of a mutation is defined by naming a handler after the remote.

     ```
     (defmutation boo
       \"docstring\" [params-map]
       (action [env] ...)
       (my-remote [env] ...)
       (other-remote [env] ...)
       (remote [env] ...))
     ```

     NOTE: Every handler in the defmutation is turned into a lambda, and that lambda will be available in `env` under
     the key `:handlers`. Thus actions and remotes can cross-call (TODO: Make the macro rewrite cross calls so they
     can look like fn calls?):

     ```
     (defmutation boo
       \"docstring\" [params-map]
       (action [env] ...)
       (ok-action [env] ...)
       (result-action [env] ((-> env :handlers :ok-action) env)))
     ```

     This macro normally adds a `:result-action` handler that does normal Fulcro mutation remote result logic unless
     you supply your own.

     Remotes in Fulcro 3 are also lambdas, and are called with an `env` that contains the state as it exists *after*
     the `:action` has run in `state`, but also include the 'before action state' as a map in `:state-before-action`.

     IMPORTANT: You can fully-qualify a mutation's symbol when declaring it to force it into a custom namespace,
     but this is highly discouraged and will require quoting when used in a mutation.

       "Define a router component.

       This is just like `defsc`, BUT generates a pair of components that optimize query performance and allow for efficient
       UI changes.  The options are identical to `defsc`, except:

       Required Options:

       - `:router-id` - An ID for the router
       - `:ident` - An ident that works across all of the routing targets. This kind of router generates a union query,
                    so this ident function must work on ALL router targets, and MUST vary the FIRST elements of the ident
                    to identiy which screen to show.
       - `:default-route` - The Class of the router target that is the default (initial) route.
       - `:router-targets` - A map of ident tables to router targets.  This map MUST correspond to the TABLE name that
       the router target lives in, and the Class of the router target component.

       You may NOT define a `:query` or `:initial-state` for a router.

       All other `defsc` options are supported.

        ```

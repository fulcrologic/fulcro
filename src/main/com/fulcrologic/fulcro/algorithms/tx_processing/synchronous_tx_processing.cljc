  "A transaction processing system that does as much synchronously as possible, and removes various elements
   of complexity that were inherited from Fulcro 2 in the standard tx processing.

   See `with-synchronous-transactions` for how to install it.

   This tx processing system does as much work synchronously as possible, though it does try to preserve the
   call-order *semantics* of the standard transaction processing: That is to say that if the optimistic action
   of a transaction submits a new transaction then that new submission will run *after* the current already-in-progress
   transaction has finished processing:

   ```
   (defmutation g [_]
     (action [{:keys [state]}] (swap! state ...))
     (ok-action [{:keys [app]}] (transact! app [(h)]))
     (remote [_] true))

   (defmutation f [_]
     (action [{:keys [state app]}]
       (swap! state ...)
       (transact! app [(g)])))

   ...
   (dom/a {:onClick (fn []
                      (transact! this [(f {:x 1})])
                      (transact! this [(f {:x 2})])
                      (transact! this [(f {:x 3})])))
   ```

   A user clicking the above link with std processing could see any of the following:

   ```
   f,f,f,g,g,g,h,h,h
   f,f,f,g,h,g,g,h,h
   f,f,f,g,g,h,g,h,h
   etc.
   ```

   In sync tx processing, you would more likely see:

   ```
   f,g,f,g,f,g,h,h,h
   ```

   because there is *no guarantee* in Fulcro's semantics about the space between two calls to `transact!`. If your
   application relies on the groupings that happen with the standard tx processing (submissions while holding a thread
   go into the queue first) then your application may break when you switch to sync processing.

   Note that transactions *are* treated as atomically as possible. So, if you want a specific grouping you should submit
   it as a single tx:

   ```
   (transact! [(f) (g)])
   (transact! [(f) (g)])
   ```

   is guaranteed to do `f,g,f,g`, and never `f,f,g,g`, though it is still possible to see `f,g,h,f,g,h`.

   This sync transaction processing system allows you to push most (if not all) behavior of even nested transactions into a single
   synchronous operation. This will lead to significant improvements in the snappiness of the UI for optimistic operation
   and should also reduce over-rendering (multiple calls to render due to multiple async operations).

   If your remote is mocked as a synchronous operation, then you can also leverage this tx processor to enable
   completely synchronous testing of your headless Fulcro application.

   WARNING: This tx processing system does *not* support:

   * `ptransact!`: Pessimistic transactions are a legacy feature of Fulcro 2 that is no longer necessary. New
   applications should not use the feature, and this sync tx processing system does not support it. The call
   will succeed, but will behave as a normal `transact!`.

  This plug-in attempts to do as much work as possible synchronously, including the processing of \"remotes\" that
  can behave synchronously. This processing system
  preserves transactional ordering semantics for nested submissions, but cannot guarantee that the overall sequence of
  operations will exactly match what you'd see if using the standard tx processing.

  The options map you can pass to `transact!` supports most of the same things as the standard tx processing, with the significant exception of
  `:optimistic? false` (pessimistic transactions). It also *always* assumes synchronous operation, thought the
  `synchronous?` option (if used) does imply that only the current component should be refreshed in the UI.

  - `:ref` - ident. The component ident to include in the transaction env.
  - `:component` - React element. The instance of the component that should appear in the transaction env.
  - `:synchronous?` - When true, causes the rendering to only refresh the calling component (if possible), since the implication
  is for fast-as-possible refresh semantics, even though this tx processing is already sync.
  - `:refresh` - A hint. Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered
    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the
    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:
    The ident-optimized render treats these as \"extras\".
  - `:only-refresh` - A hint. Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying configured rendering algorithm supports it: The
    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI, and they may be refreshed immediately on
    `transact!`. This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what
    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.

  If the `options` include `:ref` (which comp/transact! sets), then it will be auto-included on the `:refresh` list.

  Returns the transaction ID of the submitted transaction.

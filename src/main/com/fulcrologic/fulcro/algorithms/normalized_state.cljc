(def integrate-ident
  "[state ident & named-parameters]

  Integrate an ident into any number of places in the app state. This function is safe to use within mutation
  implementations as a general helper function.

  The named parameters can be specified any number of times. They are:

  - append:  A vector (path) to a list in your app state where this new object's ident should be appended. Will not append
  the ident if that ident is already in the list.
  - prepend: A vector (path) to a list in your app state where this new object's ident should be prepended. Will not place
  the ident if that ident is already in the list.
  - replace: A vector (path) to a specific location in app-state where this object's ident should be placed. Can target a to-one or to-many.
   If the target is a vector element then that element must already exist in the vector.

  NOTE: `ident` does not have to be an ident if you want to place denormalized data.  It can really be anything.

  Returns the updated state map."

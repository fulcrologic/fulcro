  - `:ref` - ident. The component ident to include in the transaction env.
  - `:component` - React element. The instance of the component that should appear in the transaction env.
  - `:refresh` - Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered
    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the
    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:
    The ident-optimized render treats these as \"extras\".
  - `:only-refresh` - Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying rendering configured algorithm supports it: The
    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI.
    This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what
    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.

  WARNING: `:only-refresh` can cause missed refreshes because rendering is debounced. If you are using this for
           rapid-fire updates like drag-and-drop it is recommended that on the trailing edge (e.g. drop) of your sequence you
           force a normal refresh via `app/render!`.

  If the `options` include `:ref` (which comp/transact! sets), then it will be auto-included on the `:refresh` list.

  NOTE: Fulcro 2 'follow-on reads' are supported and are added to the `:refresh` entries. Your choice of rendering
  algorithm will influence their necessity.

(defn fulcro-app
  "Create a new Fulcro application.

  `options`: A map of initial options

   * `:initial-db` a *map* containing a *normalized* Fulcro app db.  Normally Fulcro will populate app state with
     your component tree's initial state.  Use `mount!` options to toggle the initial state pull from root.
   * `:optimized-render!` - A function that can analyze the state of the application and optimally refresh the screen.
     Defaults to `ident-optimized-render/render!`, but can also be set to `keyframe-render/render!`.  Further customizations are
     also possible.  Most applications will likely be best with the default (which analyzes changes by ident and targets
     refreshes), but applications with a lot of on-screen components may find the keyframe renderer to be faster. Both
     get added benefits from Fulcro's default `shouldComponentUpdate`, which will prevent rendering when there are no real
     changes.
   * `default-result-action!` - A `(fn [env])` that will be used in your mutations defined with `defmutation` as the
     default `:result-action` when none is supplied. Normally defaults to a function that supports mutation joins, targeting,
     and ok/error actions. WARNING: Overriding this is for advanced users and can break important functionality. The
     default is value for this option is `com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations/default-result-action!`, which could be used
     as an element of your own custom implementation.
   * `:global-eql-transform` - A `(fn [AST] new-AST)` that will be asked to rewrite the AST of all transactions just
     before they are placed on the network layer.
   * `:client-did-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called when the application mounts the first time. WARNING: Due to
     the async nature of js and React this function is not guaranteed to be called after the application is
     completely on the DOM.  If you need that guarantee then consider using `:componentDidMount` on your application's
     root component.
   * `:remotes` - A map from remote name to a remote handler, which is defined as a map that contains at least
     a `:transmit!` key whose value is a `(fn [send-node])`. See `networking.http-remote`.
   * `:shared` - A (static) map of data that should be visible in all components through `comp/shared`.
   * `:shared-fn` - A function on root props that can select/augment shared whenever a forced root render
     or explicit call to `app/update-shared!` happens.
   * `:props-middleware` - A function that can add data to the 4th (optional) argument of
     `defsc`.  Useful for allowing users to quickly destructure extra data created by
     component extensions. See the fulcro-garden-css project on github for an example usage.
   * `:render-middleware` - A `(fn [this real-render])`. If supplied it will be called for every Fulcro component
     render, and *must* call (and return the result of) `real-render`.  This can be used to wrap the real render
     function in order to do things like measure performance, set dynamic vars, or augment the UI in arbitrary ways.
     `this` is the component being rendered.
   * `:remote-error?` - A `(fn [result] boolean)`. It can examine the network result and should only return
     true when the result is an error. The `result` will contain both a `:body` and `:status-code` when using
     the normal remotes.  The default version of this returns true if the status code isn't 200.
   * `:global-error-action` - A `(fn [env] ...)` that is run on any remote error (as defined by `remote-error?`).
   * `:load-mutation` - A symbol. Defines which mutation to use as an implementation of low-level load operations. See
     Developer's Guide
   * `:query-transform-default` - A `(fn [query] query')`. Defaults to a function that strips `:ui/...` keywords and
     form state config joins from load queries.
   * `:load-marker-default` - A default value to use for load markers. Defaults to false.
   * `:render-root!` - The function to call in order to render the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.render`.
   * `:hydrate-root!` - The function to call in order to hydrate the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.hydrate`.
   * `:unmount-root!` - The function to call in order to unmount the root of your application. Defaults
     to `js/ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`.
   * `:root-class` - The component class that will be the root. This can be specified just with `mount!`, but
   giving it here allows you to do a number of tasks against the app before it is actually mounted. You can also use `app/set-root!`."

  - `:initialize-state?` (default true) - If NOT mounted already: Pulls the initial state tree from root component,
  normalizes it, and installs it as the application's state.  If there was data supplied as an initial-db, then this
  new initial state will be *merged* with that initial-db.

  "Adds a lambda to the given data `core-response` such that `apply-response-augmentations`
  will use it to morph the raw Ring response in which the `core-response` is embedded
  (the core response becomes the `:body`).

  The `ring-response-fn` is a `(fn [resp] resp')` that will be passed a raw (possibly empty)
  Ring response which it can modify and return.

  Use this function when you need to add information into the handler response, for
  example when you need to add cookies or session data. Example:

      (defmutation my-mutate
        ...
        (augment-response
          {:uid 42} ; your regular response
          #(assoc-in % [:session :user-id] 42))) ; a function resp -> resp

  If the parser has multiple responses that use `augment-response` they will all be applied.
  The first one will receive an empty map as input. Only top level values
  of your response will be checked for augmented response (i.e. primarily mutation responses).

  See `apply-response-augmentations`, which is used by `handle-api-request`, which in turn is the
  primary implementation element of `wrap-api`."

  "Render the UI. The keyframe render runs a full UI query and then asks React to render the root component.
  The optimizations for this kind of render are purely those provided by `defsc`'s default
  shouldComponentUpdate, which causes component to act like React PureComponent (though the props compare in cljs
  is often faster).

  If `:hydrate?` is true it will use the React hydrate functionality (on browsers) to render over
  server-rendered content in the DOM.

  If `:force-root? true` is included in the options map then not only will this do a keyframe update, it will also
  force all components to return `true` from `shouldComponentUpdate`."

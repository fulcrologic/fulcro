(defn transact!
  "Submit a transaction for processing.

  The underlying transaction system is pluggable, but the *default* supported options are:

  - `:optimistic?` - boolean. Should the transaction be processed optimistically?
  - `:ref` - ident. The ident of the component used to submit this transaction. This is set automatically if you use a component to call this function.
  - `:component` - React element. Set automatically if you call this function using a component.
  - `:refresh` - Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered
    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the
    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:
    The ident-optimized render treats these as \"extras\".
  - `:only-refresh` - Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying rendering configured algorithm supports it: The
    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI.
    This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what
    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.
  - `:abort-id` - An ID (you make up) that makes it possible (if the plugins you're using support it) to cancel
    the network portion of the transaction (assuming it has not already completed).
  - `:compressible?` - boolean. Check compressible-transact! docs.
  - `:synchronous?` - boolean. When turned on the transaction will run immediately on the calling thread. If run against
  a component then the props will be immediately tunneled back to the calling component, allowing for React (raw) input
  event handlers to behave as described in standard React Forms docs (uses setState behind the scenes). Any remote operations
  will still be queued as normal. Calling `transact!!` is a shorthand for this option. WARNING: ONLY the given component will
  be refreshed in the UI. If you have dependent data elsewhere in the UI you must either use `transact!` or schedule
  your own global render using `app/schedule-render!`.
  - `:after-render?` - Wait until the next render completes before allowing this transaction to run. This can be used
  when calling `transact!` from *within* another mutation to ensure that the effects of the current mutation finish
  before this transaction takes control of the CPU. This option defaults to `false`, but `defmutation` causes it to
  be set to true for any transactions run within mutation action sections. You can affect the default for this value
  in a dynamic scope by binding `*after-render*` to true
  - `:parallel?` - Boolean. If true, the mutation(s) in the transaction will NOT go into a network queue, nor
    will it block later mutations or queries.

  You may add any additional keys to the option map (namespaced is ideal), and any value is legal in the options
  map, including functions. The options will appear in the `env` of all mutations run in the transaction as
  `:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing/options`. This is the preferred way of passing things like
  lambdas (if you wanted something like a callback) to mutations. Note that mutation symbols are perfectly legal
  as mutation *arguments*, so chaining mutations can already be done via the normal transaction mechanism, and
  callbacks, while sometimes necessary/useful, should be limited to usages where there is no other clean way
  to accomplish the goal.


  NOTE: This function calls the application's `tx!` function (which is configurable). Fulcro 2 'follow-on reads' are
  supported by the default version and are added to the `:refresh` entries. Your choice of rendering algorithm will
  influence their necessity.

  Returns the transaction ID of the submitted transaction.

  "Create an anonymous normalizing query component. By default the normalization will be auto-detected based on there being a prop at each

   ```
   [:list/id :list/name {:list/items [:item/id :item/complete? :item/label]}]

   will create a normalizing query that expects the top-level values to be normalized by `:list/id` and the nested
   items to be normalized by `:item/id`. If there is more than one ID in your props, make sure the *first* one is
   the one to use for normalization.

   The `top-component-options` becomes the options map of the component.

   You can include :componentName to push the resulting anonymous component definition into the component registry, which
   is needed by some parts of Fulcro, like UISM.

   NOTE: `nc` is recursive, and *does* compose if you want to name the components at various levels. It can be used with queries from
   other defsc components:

   ```
   (def query (nc [:user/id
                   :user/name
                   ;; Generate an anonymous component that is available in the registry under ::Session
                   {:user/session-details (nc [:session/id :session/last-login] {:componentName ::Session})}
                   ;; Use a defsc query as the source
                   {:user/settings (comp/get-query Settings)}
                   ;; Autogenerates an anonymous address query component that has no name
                   {:user/address [:address/id :address/street]}]))
   ```

(defn entity->component
  "Creates a normalizing component from an entity tree. Every sub-element of the tree provided will generate an anonymous
   normalizing component if that element has an ID field. For to-many relations only the first item is used for query/ident
   generation.

   The returned anonymous component will have initial state that matches the provided entity data tree.

   This means you can use a sample tree to generate both the initial state for a subtree of your app and the components
   necessary to do I/O on that tree.

   This kind of component will *not* be registered in the component registry unless you pass a :componentName
   via the top-level-options. A registry entry is necessary for things that
   require the registry, such as dynamic queries and UI state machines).

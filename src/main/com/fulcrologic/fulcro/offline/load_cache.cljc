(ns com.fulcrologic.fulcro.offline.load-cache
  "Support for a loading system that supports keeping previously-seen query responses in a persistent
   cache. It supports the following features:

   * Make a failed load return the last cached value.
   ** Support for a default value for the load in case you are offline and nothing is in the cache.
   * Support for an eager/fast return from cache even when online.
   ** Indicating if the actual return should just go to cache, or both cache and app merge.

   This support replaces the default definition of the `internal-load` mutation in your Fulcro app, and hooks
   cache control into the normal load options (open map). If no caching options are given in a `load!`, then
   it uses Fulcro's built-in implementation of load.

   WARNING: Mixing this with durable mutations can be a problem. You should only use a load cache on
   items that *cannot* be modified by durable mutations unless you're willing to also update the
   load cache to reflect the mutation changes; otherwise the load cache can get out of sync with the
   durable mutations and cause all manner of havoc. This facility is primarily about making well-known
   data (e.g. inventory items, dropdown options, etc.) available even when the server is not responding.

   Installation: See `with-load-cache`

   Usage: Use the `load!` and `load-eagerly!` functions from this ns. Operations in `data-fetch` ns will continue to work
   in an unmodified fashion.

(defn with-load-cache
  "Installs support for load caching to the provided app. Returns a new app, so it must be used like so:

  ```
  (defonce app (-> (fulcro-app {})
                 (with-load-cache edn-store)))
  ```

  Currently `options` is unused.

  Then you can leverage the caching using transaction options, or simply by calling the `load!` and
  `load-eagerly!` defined in this namespace.

  The transaction options (under `::txn/options` key in load parameter map) that are supported are:

  * `::use-cache` - Boolean. Use this caching support. When false, just does standard Fulcro load.
  * `::default-value` - A map or vector representing the default value to use if the load and cache both fail.
  * `::on-cached-load` - A mutation to run whenever the cache is used instead of a real response.
  * `::eager?` - Boolean. Should the cache be used optimistically?
  * `::merge-new-result?` - Boolean. Only applies if `::eager?` was set to true: should the real network result
                            be merged when it arrives? Default is false.

  This and the `load-eagerly!` functions just make it easier (mostly unnecessary) to pass these additional options.

(>defn load!
  "Load `data-fetch/load!`, but enables load caching. The default mode always tries to fetch the data as normal, and
   only resorts to the cache on failure.

   * `app-ish` - An app or component
   * `query-key` - A keyword or ident to root the server query
   * `query-component` - An optional (may be nil) component that will be used to derive the sub-graph query and normalization.
   * `default-value` is required, and one or many of `query-component` instances.
   * `options` is just like for `data-fetch/load!`. See that function for full details.

   NOTE: The normal `data-fetch/load!` actions (e.g. post mutations, targeting) will always happen, since this function
   will essentially guarantee that *some* result is available (if nothing more than the default value). Thus, it is
   impossible to see that a low-level network error even happened when using this function.

   As a result, you may supply a *mutation* via the options map as `::on-cached-load mutation`.  The mutation will be submitted
   if the load is satisfied by the cache, and will include the normalized load parameters (e.g. a map that includes
   `:query`).

   Example:

   ```
   ;; The top-level key of the server remote result will be :inventory/items, but the default-value is just the value(s)
   ;; under that key.
   (lc/load! SPA :inventory/items Item [{:item/id 1 :item/name \"boo\"}] {:target [:all-items]})

   ;; Loading by ident is fine, but the default value will then always be a map (the Item to default to in this case):
   (lc/load! SPA [:item/id 2] Item {:item/id 2 :item/name \"BAH\"})
   ```

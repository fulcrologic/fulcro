(defn transact!
  "Submit a transaction for processing.

  The underlying transaction system is pluggable, but the *default* supported options are:

  - `:optimistic?` - boolean. Should the transaction be processed optimistically?
  - `:ref` - ident. The ident of the component used to submit this transaction. This is set automatically if you use a component to call this function.
  - `:component` - React element. Set automatically if you call this function using a component.
  - `:refresh` - Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered
    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the
    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:
    The ident-optimized render treats these as \"extras\".
  - `:only-refresh` - Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying rendering configured algorithm supports it: The
    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI.
    This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what
    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.
  - `:abort-id` - An ID (you make up) that makes it possible (if the plugins you're using support it) to cancel
    the network portion of the transaction (assuming it has not already completed).
  - `:compressible?` - boolean. Check compressible-transact! docs.
  - `:synchronous?` - boolean. When turned on the transaction will run immediately on the calling thread. If run against
  a component then the props will be immediately tunneled back to the calling component, allowing for React (raw) input
  event handlers to behave as described in standard React Forms docs (uses setState behind the scenes). Any remote operations
  will still be queued as normal. Calling `transact!!` is a shorthand for this option. WARNING: ONLY the given component will
  be refreshed in the UI. If you have dependent data elsewhere in the UI you must either use `transact!` or schedule
  your own global render using `app/schedule-render!`.
  ` `:after-render?` - Wait until the next render completes before allowing this transaction to run. This can be used
  when calling `transact!` from *within* another mutation to ensure that the effects of the current mutation finish
  before this transaction takes control of the CPU. This option defaults to `false`, but `defmutation` causes it to
  be set to true for any transactions run within mutation action sections. You can affect the default for this value
  in a dynamic scope by binding `*after-render*` to true

  NOTE: This function calls the application's `tx!` function (which is configurable). Fulcro 2 'follow-on reads' are
  supported by the default version and are added to the `:refresh` entries. Your choice of rendering algorithm will
  influence their necessity.

  Returns the transaction ID of the submitted transaction.

  \"props tunneling\" (a behind-the-scenes mechanism using js/setState).

  This mode is meant to be used in form input event handlers, since React is designed to only work properly with
  raw DOM inputs via component-local state. This prevents things like the cursor jumping to the end of inputs
  unexpectedly.

  WARNING: Using an `app` instead of a component in synchronous transactions makes no sense. You must pass a component
  that has an ident.

  If you're using this, you can also set the compiler option:

  ```
  :compiler-options {:external-config {:fulcro     {:wrap-inputs? false}}}

  to turn off Fulcro DOM's generation of wrapped inputs (which try to solve this problem in a less-effective way).

   optional ident (if :ident is specified in options), optional initial state, optional css, lifecycle methods,
   and a render method. It can also cause the class to implement additional protocols that you specify. Destructuring is
   supported in the argument list.

   The template (data-only) versions do not have any arguments in scope
   The lambda versions have arguments in scope that make sense for those lambdas, as listed below:

   ```
   (defsc Component [this {:keys [db/id x] :as props} {:keys [onSelect] :as computed} extended-args]

      ;; stateful component options
      ;; query template is literal. Use the lambda if you have ident-joins or unions.
      :query [:db/id :x] ; OR (fn [] [:db/id :x]) ; this in scope
      ;; ident template is table name and ID property name
      :ident [:table/by-id :id] ; OR (fn [] [:table/by-id id]) ; this and props in scope
      ;; initial-state template is magic..see dev guide. Lambda version is normal.
      :initial-state {:x :param/x} ; OR (fn [params] {:x (:x params)}) ; nothing is in scope

      :pre-merge (fn [{:keys [data-tree current-normalized state-map query]}] (merge {:ui/default-value :start} data-tree))

      ;; NOTE: The state returned from this function can either be:
      ;; a raw js map, where Fulcro's state is in a sub-key: `#js {\"fulcro$state\" {:fulcro :state}}`.
      ;; or a clj map. In either case this function will *overwrite* Fulcro's component-local state, which is
      ;; slighly different behavior than raw React (we have no `this`, so we cannot read Fulcro's state to merge it).
      :getDerivedStateFromError  (fn [error] ...)

      NOTE: shouldComponentUpdate should generally not be overridden other than to force it false so
      that other libraries can control the sub-dom. If you do want to implement it, then old props can
      be obtained from (prim/props this), and old state via (gobj/get (. this -state) \"fulcro$state\").

      ; BODY forms. May be omitted IFF there is an options map, in order to generate a component that is used only for queries/normalization.
      (dom/div #js {:onClick onSelect} x))
   ```

   NOTE: The options map is \"open\". That is: you can add whatever extra stuff you want to in order
   to co-locate data for component-related concerns. This is exactly what component-local css, the
   dynamic router, and form-state do.  The data that you add is available from `comp/component-options`
   on the component class and instances (i.e. `this`).

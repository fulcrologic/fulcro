== Fulcro 2.0

Fulcro 2.0 maintains the majority of API compatibility with 1.0, but has forked from Om Next due to
a number of things:

* We wanted better control of our release cycle and bug fix schedule.
* Om's support of pluggable databases causes a number of complications we didn't need.
* Dynamic queries in Om Next use patterns that are at odds with some quite useful features:
** True serializable support viewer history in the presence of dynamic queries
** Reliable history navigation for error recovery
* The rendering optimizations in stock Om Next were quite aggressive, but led to quite a bit
of complication under the hood, which in turn showed up as bugs. Fulcro's choice of the built-in database format makes
these optimizations easier and hopefully more reliable.

=== Porting From Fulcro 1.0

1. Remove Om Next from your dependencies, if present
2. Update to Fulcro 2.0+
3. Update to Fulcro-spec 2.0+ (if using it)
4. Rename all of the Om namespaces to use the new ones in Fulcro, which are mostly API-compatible:
+
In Linux and OSX (assuming your project is in git), this `rename-ns` script is useful:
+
```
#!/bin/bash

oldns=$1
newns=$2
files=$(git grep -l "$oldns")

if [ ! -z "$files" ]; then
  perl -pi.bak -e 's/\b\Q'$oldns'\E\b/'$newns'/g' $files
  find . -name '*.bak' -print0 | xargs -0 -n100 rm
fi
```
+
You'll want to rename things *in order* (assuming you're using the above script):
+
```
rename-ns om.next.impl.parser fulcro.client.impl.parser
rename-ns om.next.protocols fulcro.client.impl.protocols
rename-ns om.next.server fulcro.server
rename-ns om.dom fulcro.client.dom
rename-ns om.tempid fulcro.tempid
rename-ns om.util fulcro.util
rename-ns om.next fulcro.client.primitives
rename-ns fulcro.client.core fulcro.client
```
+
5. Fix your use of `util` namespaces. There are now two util namespaces. This is an unfortunate consequence of the
forking import process.
** `get-ident` is now just part of the `primitives` namespace
** The following functions that were in `fulcro.client.util` were moved to `fulcro.util`:
`unique-key`, `atom?`, `deep-merge`, and `conform!`
6. Fix any uses of `load-action` or `load-field-action` to pass the `env` instead of just the state atom. In 1.0 either
was OK. In 2.0 it has to be the full mutation `env`.

=== Dynamic Queries

If you don't use dynamic queries in Fulcro 1.0, then you're done!

If you've been wanting to use them but had problems because of how Om Next did them, read on!

Om Next supports setting queries at a component level (e.g. every instance on the screen). In reality, this doesn't
work very well (and is difficult to code correctly). Component instances cannot be stored in app state unless you're
willing to give up history serialization, and to-many relationships present real difficulties (imagine wanting to
set the query of the 2nd item in a list). Spurious React mount/unmounts will also lose your queries. Imagine changine
from one tab to another and back again only to have your dynamic queries clear in the original tab you just returned
to (because of the mount/unmount).

Fulcro 2.0 changes the appraoch. Instead of storing the queries in the indexer and state by React component, we
instead allow you to define the query ID (which is serializable). However, dynamic queries of this kind don't hide
the magic. The API for dynamic queries exposes the fact that getting a query is a function of the component's query ID
AND application state (since that is where custom ones are stored).

==== The trade-offs:

There is no free lunch. Fulcro 2.0's dynamic queries require you to basically give queries an identity. As such,
they have the following properties:

* You may set a query class-wide. All instances on screen that share that class will use the new query.
* You may target a new query to a specific React factory (with a qualifier). This allows you to dynamically set a query
on a subset of on-screen components that share a class.

The down-side is that you cannot arbitrarily set a query on an arbitrary on-screen component without involving a custom
factory for that instance. That would require indexing by component React instace, and just doesn't work well with other
features (react re-mounts and serializable history). In practice dynamic queries are mainly needed for code splitting,
and the fact that you can re-use a single class with as many different qualifiers as you want means that the vast
majority of dynamic query desires can be easily met.

==== Query IDs

Query IDs are composed of two components: A component's class name, and an optional user-defined keyword qualifier. The
class and qualifier are needed when asking Fulcro for a query, and React instances that need targeted refresh will also
need to supply the underlying engine with the Query ID they were originally rendered with.

This implies that the best way to "name" a query without having to repeat yourself is by using a factory
(which has to know the class name and the qualifier in order to work). Thus,
Fulcro dynamic queries can define a factory with a query qualifier like so:

```
(def ui-thing-a (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :a}))
(def ui-thing-b (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :b}))
```

The example above gives you two separate kinds of `Thing` that can have their query set dynamically. If the qualifier is not
set, then setting a query on the given class will affect all instances on the screen that have that class.

==== The Dynamic Query API

If you just want to be able to change the query class-wide, then there are no source changes to your components. If
you'd like to be able to change the queries for specific instances, then you'll have to involve factories in your
query functions. This also means you need to use the lambda form of the new defsc macro. In `defui`, nothing changes
except the use of factories:


```
(ns ui
  (:require [fulcro.client.primitives :as prim :refer [defsc]]))

(declare ui-thing-a)

(defsc Thing [this props]
  {:query (fn [] [:prop {:join (prim/get-query ui-thing-a state)}]) }
  ...
  )

; OR

(defui Thing
  static prim/IQuery
  (query [this] [:prop {:join (prim/get-query ui-thing-a state)}])
  ...)

(def ui-thing-a (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :a}))
```

The new `set-query!` has an API change to match (you must pass a class, factory, or query ID):

```
(set-query! this ui-factory {:query [:x]})
```

There is a `set-query*` function for SSR initial app setup so you can pre-populate dynamic queries. There is also
a mutation version you can call directly from `transact!`: `fulcro.client.mutations/set-query!`.

=== Status

* Om Next is no longer a dependency. The relevant code has been imported, and simplified internally. A lot of this
was to fix dynamic queries, and make the rendering refresh a bit simpler.
* Fulcro's `defsc` macro was expanded and is now the recommended way to build components
* `defui` still exists, and is 100% API-compatible with Om Next's
* Advanced optimization works, and does not rely on the compiler hacks that were present in Om Next.
* Dynamic queries work in a general purpose and serializable way.
** Query parameters (e.g. IQueryParams) wasn't changed.
* Other than the renames and a few minor function moves (from util), it should be API-compatible with existing Fulcro apps
* Rendering should should be at least as fast as stock Om Next in most circumstances. It should be faster in many, but there
are some circumstances where it could be slower.
* New history recording and viewer work (tested against todo mvc)
** History now contains client timestamps, db before/after, the transaction itself, and whatever the mutation functions returned.
** History API is now richer. It includes a navigator for moving around. See `fulcro.history`.
** History tracks networking so that old history isn't removed until the network actions related to it complete.
* There are a number of new features:
** Mutation joins (returning entities from server mutations)
** Load markers can now be normalized and queried directly (instead of stomping on your data)
** Targeting of loads is more capable (can target to-many with append/prepend, and multiple different places all at once)
** Pessimistic transactions! You can now have the items in a full-stack mutation run one at a time (in a full-stack sense)
** Compressible transactions. You can now ask the history to elide steps of history, like side-by-side keystrokes.
** Every change to app state (except your raw swaps) is now a transaction internally (`set-query!`, `merge!`, and `transact!`). This
means that all strucutured progression of your app is properly recorded in history!
** Should work with React 16 and Clojure 1.9. Not heavily tested in either yet, though. There are some React 16 things that could
break your apps if you use deprecated things. Many existing React libraries have yet to port.
